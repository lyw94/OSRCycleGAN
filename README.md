# OSRCycleGAN

This is the CycleGAN for Ocular Super-resolution.

The original paper of this model is in submission.

### A features of this model's

This model was decreased the number of filters in half.
And the input size is not limited, it means that use any resolution of inputs can be used.
Additionally, adapted perceptual loss that uses a pre-trained ocular classifier model based on ResNet architecture is used.

more details will be appended here after publication.
